        ANDAMAN AND NICOBAR ISLANDS </h1>
        <h2 style="font-family: 'Courier New'; color: rgb(31, 72, 161);">HISTORY</h2>
        <p> In the 11th century CE, Rajendra Chola I of the Chola dynasty of Tamilakam invaded parts of South East Asia using the Nicobar islands as an intermediate naval base. It was part of an established Chola trade route connecting India and South East Asia, with the practice continuing in the subsequent years during the reigns of Rajendra II and Kulothunga I Chola inscriptions from Thanjavur, dated to 1050 CE, describe the islands as Ma-Nakkavaram meaning "great open/naked land" in Tamil.The islands are later mentioned by Marco Polo in the 13th century CE and Friar Oderic in early 14th century CE.
         In 1789, the British colonised the Andaman islands to set up a naval base and establish a penal colony. In 1794, a first batch of 100 prisoners were sent to the island but the settlement was abandoned in 1796.
         The provisional control was passed on to the Azad Hind of Subhash Chandra Bose on 29 December 1943, based on the understanding with the Japanese with the islands renamed as Shaheed-Dweep (Martyr Island) and Swaraj-dweep (Self-rule Island).Bose appointed General A. D. Loganathan as the governor of the islands, who had limited power while the real control of the islands remained with the Japanese.The archipelago consists of approximately 572 islands, of which about 36 are inhabited. The two main groups are:
         Andaman Islands: The northern group, which includes islands like North Andaman, Middle Andaman, South Andaman, and Havelock Island.
         Nicobar Islands: The southern group, which includes Nicobar, Car Nicobar, and others. It is under the administration of the Central Government of India.</p> 
        <h2 style="font-family: 'Courier New'; color: rgb(31, 72, 161);"> ABOUT THE CAPITAL CITY</h2> 
        <p>Port Blair officially known as Sri Vijaya Puram, is the capital city of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a union territory of India in the Bay of Bengal. Port Blair is the entry point for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is connected with mainland India by both air and sea. It is home to several museums and the major naval base INS Jarawa of the Indian Navy, along with sea and air bases of the Indian Coast Guard, Andaman and Nicobar Police, Andaman and Nicobar Command, the first integrated tri-command between the Indian Armed Forces, Indian Air Force and the navy. The historic Cellular Jail is in the city, and nearby small islands such as Corbyn's Cove, Wandoor, Ross Island and Viper Island were once home to British colonists. The city was named after Captain Archibald Blair, a British colonial navy official of the East India Company. On 13 September 2024, the Government of India renamed the city to Sri Vijaya Puram.

        <p>Gujarat has a rich and diverse history that dates back to ancient times. It was part of the Indus Valley Civilization, with significant archaeological sites like <strong>Lothal</strong> and <strong>Dholavira</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>The region has been influenced by various dynasties, including the <strong>Mauryas</strong>, <strong>Guptas</strong>, and the <strong>Solankis</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>In the medieval period, Gujarat became a prominent center for trade and commerce, attracting merchants from across the world. The region was later ruled by the <strong>Sultanate of Gujarat</strong> and the <strong>Mughal Empire</strong>, contributing to its cultural and architectural heritage.</p>
    
    <p>The 19th century saw the rise of the princely state of <strong>Baroda</strong> and significant social reforms. Gujarat played a pivotal role in India’s independence movement, with leaders like <strong>Mahatma Gandhi</strong> emerging from the region.</p>
    
    <p>Post-independence, Gujarat became a state in 1960 and has since developed into a key economic hub in India. Its vibrant culture, including folk traditions, cuisine, and festivals, reflects its historical legacy.</p>

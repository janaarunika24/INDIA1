        <h2 style="font-family: 'Courier New'; color: rgb(13, 5, 129) ;">HISTORY</h2>
        <p>
            Jharkhand, located in eastern India, was formed on November 15, 2000, as the 28th state of India. The region has a rich cultural and historical background, with its roots tracing back to the ancient times of the tribal communities that inhabited the area.
        </p>
        <h3>PREHISTORIC ERA</h3>
        <p>
            Evidence of human settlement in Jharkhand dates back to the prehistoric era, with various archaeological findings indicating a long history of habitation.
        </p>
        <h3>ANCIENT AND MEDIEVAL PERIOD</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout ancient and medieval times, Jharkhand was ruled by various dynasties, including the Mauryas and the Guptas. The region was known for its rich mineral resources and tribal culture.
        </p>
        <h3>BRITISH COLONIAL ERA</h3>
        <p>
            During the British colonial period, Jharkhand was part of the larger province of Bihar. The exploitation of its natural resources, especially minerals, led to significant economic changes and social unrest among the tribal populations.
        </p>
        <h3>STATEHOOD MOVEMENT</h3>
        <p>
            The demand for a separate state of Jharkhand began in the 20th century, driven by the need for better governance and recognition of tribal rights. After years of struggle and protests, Jharkhand was officially carved out of Bihar.
        </p>
        <h3>MODERN ERA</h3>
        <p>
            Since its formation, Jharkhand has focused on development while preserving its cultural heritage. The state continues to work on issues such as poverty alleviation, education, and infrastructure development.

        WEST BENGAL </h1>
        <h2 style="font-family: 'Courier New'; color: rgb(177, 160, 5);">HISTORY</h2>
      <p>West Bengal, a state in eastern India, boasts a rich and diverse history spanning over 2,000 years. The ancient era saw Bengal as part of the Mauryan Empire under Ashoka's rule (300 BC), followed by the Gupta Empire (320-550 AD), during which Bengal flourished. The Pala Dynasty (750-1174 AD) marked Bengal's golden era, with significant advancements in Buddhist and Hindu traditions.

        In the medieval era, Bengal came under Muslim rule with the Delhi Sultanate (1204-1358 AD) and later became an independent kingdom under the Bengal Sultanate (1342-1538 AD). The Mughal Empire (1538-1717 AD) subsequently ruled Bengal, leaving an indelible mark on its architecture, culture, and cuisine.
        
        The British East India Company's victory in the Battle of Plassey (1757) ushered in the British era, with Bengal becoming a presidency (1756-1912). The Indian Rebellion of 1857 saw Bengal play a pivotal role. The partition of Bengal in 1947 divided the region into West Bengal (India) and East Bengal (Pakistan, now Bangladesh), leading to a massive refugee influx.
        
        In the modern era, West Bengal has been shaped by notable figures like Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Rabindranath Tagore. The state's cultural heritage is reflected in its literature, music, art, and cuisine. From Bengali folk songs to Rabindra Sangeet, and from the Bengal School of Art to delicious fish and rice dishes, West Bengal's history is a testament to its resilience and contributions to India's struggle for independence.
        
        Today, West Bengal continues to be a vibrant and culturally rich state, proud of its complex history and diverse traditions.</p>
